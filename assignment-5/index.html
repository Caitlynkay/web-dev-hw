    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <p>
    I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
    <br>
    When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
    <br>
    But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
    <br>
    With my father in a casket, I had no plans, yeah
    <br>
    <br>
    And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
    <br>
    And it hardened like my hear did when you left town
    <br>
    But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
    <br>
    Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around
    <br>
    <br>
    But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
    <br>
    And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
    <br>
    <br>
    While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
    <br>
    Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
    <br>
    So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
    <br>
    From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you
    <br>
    <br>
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
<br>
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
<br>
<br>
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
<br>
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part
<br>
<br>
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
<br>
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
<br>
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
<br>
It's a bed and a bathroom
<br>
And a place for the end
<br>
<br>
I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
<br>
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
