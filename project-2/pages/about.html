 <h3>About</h3>
 <p>
 While experimenting with different shakes and smoothies, I accidentally created the <b>BEST</b>
 shake ever. With <i>simple</i> ingredients and being easy to make, it's a dessert you <u>must try!</u>
 I don't know about you, but I love a good dessert. When I realized I could modify this sweet treat,
 I started to experiment with different ingredients, and ended up with not only the best recipe for a cake
 batter shake, but different alternatives too! Usually with a cake batter shake, you use
 vanilla ice cream, but I always using a nonfat frozen yogurt. It tastes exactly the same, but is a little
 less heavy. Also, with this formula, you can make a dairy free alternative, which consists of almond milk,
 dairy free ice cream of your choice (some use coconut milk icecream), and cake batter mix
 (most consist of NO dairy).
