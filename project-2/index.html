<h3>About</h3>
<p>
While experimenting with different shakes and smoothies, I accidentally created the <b>BEST</b>
shake ever. With <i>simple</i> ingredients and being easy to make, it's a dessert you <u>must try!</u>
I don't know about you, but I love a good dessert. When I realized I could also make a (somewhat)
healthier option to this sweet treat, I started to experiment with different ingredients.
And ended up with the best recipe for a cake batter shake!
