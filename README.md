# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## Caitlyn Patel

I decided to take Web Design because I believe it will be a tool that will help me in my future career. I have no background in this field so I think it will take me a while to get the hang of it, but I am excited about this course.

But what exactly is the internet?
* From the video, I learned that it was the result of another experiment called the Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).
* No one actually runs the internet (or everybody runs the internet).
* It's a way to communicate and connect with one another.
