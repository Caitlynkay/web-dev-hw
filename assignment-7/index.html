  <h1>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h1>
  <h2>By J.K. Rowling (1998)</h2>
  <h3>The Boy Who Lived</h3>
<div class="paragraph-1">
  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that <br>
    they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people <br>
    you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they <br>
    just didn't hold with such nonsense.
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="paragraph-2">
  Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. <br>
  He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large <br>
   mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual <br>
   amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time <br>
   craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small
 son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. <br>
</div>
 <br>
 <div class="paragraph-3">
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their <br>
greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could <br>
bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's <br>
sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended <br>
she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband <br>
were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think <br>
what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys <br>
knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. <br>
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want <br>
Dudley mixing with a child like that. <br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="paragraph-4">
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, <br>
there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and <br>
mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley <br>
hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped <br>
away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
</div>
<br>
<div class="paragraph-5">
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
</div>
<br>
<div class="paragraph-6">
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on <br>
the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now <br>
having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. "Little tyke," chortled <br>
Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number <br>
four's drive.
<div>
<br>
<div class="paragraph-7">
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign ofsomething <br>
peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursleymdidn't realize what <br>
he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby <br>
cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. <br>
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. <br>
</div>
<br>
<div class="paragraph-8">
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove <br>
around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now <br>
reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats <br>
couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the <br>
cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large <br> 
order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
