# Assignment-4 Technical Report

### What is "alt text," and why do we use it?
Alt text (alternative text), are used within an HTML code to describe the function and appearance of an image on a page. The description is used by screen readers for those who are visually impaired.

### Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?
I come across forms on a daily basis while browsing the web, from my Facebook login to searching on google. Forms and form elements are used to collect data and information from users on websites.

### Work Cycle
For this assignment, first, I went through all of the steps on the module. I read through all of the assigned readings, and then switched over to moodle. From moodle, I downloaded the folder materials, then I created my index.html file. I went through all of the steps on moodle and started my assignment.
